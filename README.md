# choosing-the-right-attire
A program to help you decide what to wear based on the occasion.

This is my very first program written in C++. It includes structs, loops, arrays and functions. 
I created it for the purpose of learning and also seeing how capable I am at programming! 
Or at least to see how much I know. It is very basic. 
It could definitly be added to so please do so if you like!

Thanks for stopping by!
